# examples

Examples for I2C ssd1306 and st7567 displays:

* 'demo   ' : just a bunch of fonts, colors and alignments. Goot for 'playing' with to see how things work in practice
* 'counter' : a simple uptime counter

See comments for pin assignments etc.

## These have been tested on displays connected to an ESP32 and to a RP2040
clipping, colors, transparency, alignment all work.
