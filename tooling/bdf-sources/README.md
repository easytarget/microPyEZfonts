# Source `.bdf` files for the font packs.

These files originated from the U8G2 project's font tooling here:
https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/tree/master/tools/font/bdf

Not all files from the source are here, this selection has been curated for relevance and licence.

Some files (notably the *openiconic* ones) have been edited to correct dimension or metadata info in them that caused font generation errors and defects.
